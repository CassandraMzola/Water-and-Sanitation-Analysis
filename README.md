# Water and Sanitation Data Analysis Project

## Objective
To analyze global trends in water and sanitation access across countries from 2000 to 2020, assessing the differences in access between rural and urban populations, identifying regions with the most significant disparities, and understanding the implications for public health and quality of life.

## Key Questions
1. Which countries or regions have the lowest and highest access to safe drinking water and sanitation?
2. How does water and sanitation access differ between rural and urban areas?
3. What trends can be observed over time in water and sanitation access improvements?
4. What are the implications of access levels on public health and quality of life in different regions?
5. How do various factors (such as income levels, education, and geography) influence access to water and sanitation services?

## Approach
1. **Data Collection**: Gather datasets related to water and sanitation access from reputable sources.
2. **Data Cleaning and Preparation**: Clean and organize the dataset for analysis.
3. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Explore the dataset to identify patterns and trends.
4. **Advanced Analysis**: Use Excel for detailed analysis and visualizations.
5. **Data Storytelling and Visualization**: Create a comprehensive report or dashboard summarizing findings.
6. **Presentation of Findings**: Prepare a presentation to communicate insights effectively.
